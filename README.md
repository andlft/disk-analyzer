- client argument parsing (POSIX getopt)
- ipc (2 options)
    - sockets
        - handles multiple clients
        - serializing and deserializing results is complicated
    - shared memory
        - handling multiple simultaneous client calls? (probably out of scope)
        - no (de)serialization
    - both??
- daemon
    - array of thread ids and state
        - reallocation?? :notlikethis:
    - (1): `pthread_create`, ez
        - (b): recursive basename() and check for existence
    - (2): `pthread_cancel`? or running state + polling?
    - (3): `pthread_suspend`? or mutexes?
    - (4): query state
    - task progress - query number of files in first level? all levels?
    - traversal
        - nftw
        - don't follow symlinks
- printing results in client
    - if sockets, must deserialize the data
    - pretty printing can be complex
